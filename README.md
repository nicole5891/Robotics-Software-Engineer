<b>Project 1 - Build My World</b></br>
Built a world in Gazebo and learn to make plugins to use your script.</br>

<b>Project 2 (located in catkin_ws folder) - Go Chase it</b></br>
Using ROS - in this project the robot chases the white ball when it is in view. Sensor data (lidar, camera) is visualized with rviz. 

<b>Project 3 - Where Am I</b></br>
In this project it focuses on Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL) for localizing the robot in the pgm map.  Using particle cloud you can see where the robot is inside the map.

<b>Project 4 - Map My World</b></br>
Create a 2d occupancy grid and 3d Octomap from the simulated enviroment using RTAB-map package and the robot from the previous projects.

<b>Project 5 - Home Service Robot</b></br>
Create a Home Service Robot in ROS.
